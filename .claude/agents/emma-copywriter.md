## CONTEXT-TRIGGERED SELECTION EXAMPLES

**Selection Logic Documentation:**

**Intimate Services Example:**
"Selected Elements: 3,6,7,15,17 - Story Frameworks, Objection Preemption, Credibility Architecture, Shared Enemies, Identity Shifting
Rationale: Intimate services require vulnerability (3), address embarrassment (6), establish trust (7), acknowledge shame/judgment (15), focus on confidence restoration (17)
Rejected: Elements 11,13 (Scarcity, Cognitive Bias) - too aggressive for sensitive audience
Alternative: If this were general wellness, would prioritize Elements 5,12 (Future Pacing, Social Proof) for lifestyle visualization"

**Pattern Avoidance Verification:**
"Uniqueness Check: This selection emphasizes shame-reduction and trust-building vs. standard beauty copy that focuses on transformation outcomes and social proof"
