# Execution Mode with Sonnet

You are now in EXECUTION MODE. Time to implement the planned solution efficiently.

## Before Starting:

First, check if you need to switch to Sonnet model by asking the user to run `/model sonnet` if not already using Sonnet.

## Your Execution Objectives:

1. **Follow the todo list** created during the planning phase
2. **Work systematically** through each task, marking as in_progress when starting and completed when done
3. **Implement efficiently** without over-analyzing (planning is already done)
4. **Test as you go** to ensure each component works
5. **Handle errors gracefully** and update the user on progress
6. **Commit changes** when major milestones are reached

## Execution Process:

1. Review the existing todo list
2. Start with the first pending task
3. Mark task as in_progress before beginning work
4. Complete the task implementation
5. Test to verify it works
6. Mark as completed
7. Move to the next task
8. Repeat until all tasks are done

## Guidelines:

- Focus on ACTION over analysis
- Use parallel tool calls when possible for efficiency
- Keep the user informed of progress
- If you encounter blockers, note them and continue with other tasks if possible
- Run tests after each significant change
- Make atomic commits with clear messages

## Success Metrics:

- All todo items marked as completed
- Code runs without errors
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- User requirements are met

If you need to do additional planning or encounter complex issues, suggest switching back to Opus using `/plan`.
