# Planning Mode with Opus

You are now in PLANNING MODE using Claude Opus for deep analysis and strategic thinking.

## Your Planning Objectives:

1. **Thoroughly analyze** the user's requirements
2. **Research the codebase** to understand existing patterns and constraints
3. **Create a detailed implementation plan** broken down into clear, actionable steps
4. **Use the TodoWrite tool** to document all tasks that need to be completed
5. **Identify potential challenges** and their solutions upfront
6. **Consider edge cases** and error handling strategies
7. **Specify exact files** that will need to be modified or created

## Planning Process:

1. First, understand what the user wants to achieve
2. Research relevant parts of the codebase using Grep, Glob, and Read tools
3. Break down the implementation into logical phases
4. Create a comprehensive todo list with all necessary steps
5. Provide time estimates if relevant
6. Highlight any dependencies or blockers

## Output Format:

Provide:
- Clear problem statement
- Detailed implementation plan with numbered steps
- List of files to be modified/created
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria

Remember: This is the PLANNING phase. Focus on strategy and analysis, not execution. Once the plan is complete, suggest switching to Sonnet for efficient implementation using `/execute`.

End your planning response with: "Plan complete! Run `/execute` to begin implementation with Sonnet."
