# Opus-Sonnet Workflow Guide

This command explains the efficient Opus-Sonnet workflow for complex tasks.

## Workflow Overview

**Opus → Plan** | **Sonnet → Execute**

### The Two-Phase Approach:

1. **PLANNING PHASE** (Opus - Deep Analysis)
   - Use `/plan` command
   - Leverages Opus's superior reasoning
   - Thorough codebase research
   - Detailed task breakdown
   - Risk assessment
   - Creates comprehensive todo list

2. **EXECUTION PHASE** (Sonnet - Fast Implementation)
   - Use `/execute` command
   - Switch to Sonnet with `/model sonnet`
   - Rapid, efficient implementation
   - Follows the established plan
   - Focuses on doing, not thinking

## How to Use This Workflow:

### Step 1: Start Planning
```
/plan
Tell me what you want to build...
```

### Step 2: Switch Models
```
/model sonnet
```

### Step 3: Execute Plan
```
/execute
```

### Step 4: Switch Back if Needed
```
/model opus
/plan
(for complex debugging or replanning)
```

## Why This Works:

- **Opus Strengths**: Complex reasoning, pattern recognition, strategic planning
- **Sonnet Strengths**: Fast execution, efficient coding, quick iterations
- **Combined**: Best of both worlds - thorough planning with rapid implementation

## Example Workflow:

1. User: "I need to add a new payment integration"
2. Run `/plan` → Opus analyzes requirements, researches codebase, creates detailed plan
3. Run `/model sonnet` → Switch to faster model
4. Run `/execute` → Sonnet implements the plan efficiently
5. If stuck: `/model opus` and `/plan` for complex problem-solving

## Available Commands:

- `/plan` - Enter planning mode with Opus
- `/execute` - Enter execution mode (best with Sonnet)
- `/workflow` - Show this guide
- `/model sonnet` - Switch to Sonnet
- `/model opus` - Switch to Opus

## Tips:

- Always plan complex tasks first
- Don't skip planning for non-trivial work
- Use Sonnet for routine implementations
- Switch back to Opus when stuck
- Keep todo list updated throughout
