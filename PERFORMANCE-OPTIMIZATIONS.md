# Performance Optimizations - October 2025

## Summary

Implemented critical performance optimizations to improve PageSpeed Insights scores and reduce page load times.

### Before Optimization (PageSpeed Mobile Score: 33/100)
- **Performance**: 33 (Poor)
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: 5.6s
- **TBT (Total Blocking Time)**: 3,610ms
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: 1.0s
- **Profile Image**: 1.18MB PNG
- **HTML Size**: 2.32MB
- **No resource hints** for external domains

### After Optimization (Expected Improvement)
- **Profile Image**: 3.56KB WebP (99.7% reduction)
- **HTML Size**: 2.25MB (2.9% reduction)
- **Resource Hints**: Added dns-prefetch and preconnect for external domains
- **GTM Script**: Async loading enabled
- **Expected Performance**: 50-60+ (improvement from reduced image size and resource hints)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Image Optimization ✅
**Impact: High - Saved 1.18MB**

- Converted `image_1759916703940.png` (1.18MB) to WebP format
- Resized to 192x192px (2x display size for retina screens)
- Final size: 3.56KB (99.7% reduction)
- Added `<picture>` element with WebP source and PNG fallback for browser compatibility
- Added explicit width/height attributes to prevent layout shift

**Files Created:**
- `attached_assets/profile-dr-lim.webp` (3.56KB)
- `optimize-images.js` (automated image optimization script)

### 2. Resource Hints ✅
**Impact: Medium - Improves third-party resource loading**

Added DNS prefetching and preconnection for external domains:
- Google Tag Manager (`www.googletagmanager.com`)
- Google Analytics (`www.google-analytics.com`)
- Unsplash Images (`images.unsplash.com`)
- Lead Connector API (`api.leadconnectorhq.com`)

This allows the browser to resolve DNS and establish connections earlier in the page load process.

### 3. HTML Minification ✅
**Impact: Low-Medium - Saved 70KB (2.9%)**

- Implemented HTML minification using `html-minifier-terser`
- Collapsed whitespace
- Removed comments
- Minified inline CSS and JavaScript
- GTM script automatically converted to async loading

**Files Created:**
- `minify-html.js` (automated HTML minification script)

### 4. Build Process Updates ✅

Updated `package.json` with new build scripts:

```json
{
  "optimize-images": "node optimize-images.js",
  "minify-html": "node minify-html.js",
  "build:prod": "npm run optimize-images && npm run build && npm run minify-html",
  "netlify-build": "npm run build:prod"
}
```

**Production Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This runs:
1. Image optimization (Sharp)
2. Tailwind CSS compilation and minification
3. HTML minification

## Files Modified

- `index.html` - Minified, added resource hints, updated image references to WebP
- `package.json` - Added optimization scripts and build process
- `.gitignore` - Added backup file exclusions

## Files Created

- `optimize-images.js` - Automated image optimization with Sharp
- `minify-html.js` - Automated HTML minification
- `attached_assets/profile-dr-lim.webp` - Optimized profile image
- `.gitignore` - Ignore backup and temp files
- `PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATIONS.md` - This document

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

### High Priority
1. **Code Splitting**: Extract large inline JavaScript (~540 lines) to external file with defer attribute
   - Current: All JS inline, blocking HTML parsing
   - Goal: Separate critical from non-critical JavaScript

2. **Critical CSS**: Extract above-the-fold CSS and inline it, defer the rest
   - Current: 120KB output.css loaded synchronously
   - Goal: Inline critical CSS, load rest with `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"`

3. **Lazy Loading**: Implement intersection observer-based lazy loading for all images
   - Current: Loading="lazy" attribute used, but could be enhanced
   - Goal: Only load images as they enter viewport

### Medium Priority
4. **Convert More Assets to WebP**: Check for other large PNG/JPG files
   - `attached_assets/` directory has 13MB of PNG screenshots
   - Most aren't used in production, but should be converted if needed

5. **Remove Unused CSS**: Use PurgeCSS or similar to remove unused Tailwind classes
   - Current: 120KB output.css (minified)
   - Goal: < 50KB by removing unused utilities

6. **Service Worker**: Add offline support and caching strategy
   - Cache static assets (CSS, JS, images)
   - Network-first for API calls

### Low Priority
7. **HTTP/2 Server Push**: Push critical resources
8. **Brotli Compression**: Enable on server for better compression than gzip
9. **CDN**: Consider serving static assets from CDN

## Performance Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:5000
```

### Production Testing
After deploying to GitHub Pages:
1. Visit https://pagespeed.web.dev/
2. Enter: https://www.stellah.ai
3. Run mobile and desktop tests
4. Compare scores with baseline (mobile: 33/100)

**Expected Improvements:**
- LCP: Should improve by ~1-2s due to smaller images
- FCP: Should improve slightly due to resource hints
- Performance Score: Expected 50-60+ (up from 33)

## Deployment

### Auto-Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Performance optimizations: image optimization, resource hints, HTML minification"
git push origin main
```

Deployment happens automatically via GitHub Pages (1-2 minutes).

### Manual Build
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

## Maintenance

### Before Each Deploy
1. Run `npm run build:prod` to optimize all assets
2. Test locally with `npm start`
3. Verify images are properly optimized
4. Check HTML is minified

### Monitoring
- Monitor PageSpeed Insights monthly
- Track Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Watch for performance regressions

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "sharp": "^0.34.4",           // Image optimization
  "html-minifier-terser": "^7.2.0"  // HTML minification
}
```

## Estimated Impact

Based on the optimizations:
- **Mobile Performance Score**: 33 → 50-60+ (expected)
- **Image Load Time**: -1.18MB (significant improvement)
- **HTML Download Time**: -70KB (minor improvement)
- **DNS Resolution**: Faster for third-party resources

The biggest win is the 1.18MB image reduction. This will significantly improve LCP on mobile connections.
